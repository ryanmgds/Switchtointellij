## TODO'S


# Coder Joe's
This is our first website. This is a store where you can get healthy food options and are given recipes to many dishes. We also linked our project concept, plan, and journals.

## Main store
This will give the newest foods we discovered and our most famous recipes.

## Healthy Lunches & Dinners
This is where you can find recipes to healthy lunches and dinners. You can get discriptions of the foods and recipes.

## Tasty Desserts
This is where you can find recipes and descriptions of our most famous desserts.

# Other Shopping
Whenever your bored with shopping or looking for recipes, you can look at coding jokes and different coding videos for joy and entertainment! 

## Youtube, Home, and Shopping Cart Icons
You can click on the youtube icon that will take you to a page that will provide you with easy to make dishes. The shopping cart icon is where you can add recipes and foods you want to buy to your bag. You can click the home button to return to the home page.


## Usage of Github
We used Github to share code so we could all make our own adjustments without messing up the main. 
## Usage of IntelliJ
We all tried to switch to this because Repl was giving us problems. Brayden switched from VS Code to InteliJ. We all followed along with the video from Dane in class this week
## Usage of Flask and routes
We used flask to make our webiste and we had many app.route so that when you click on the word, it brings you to a new webpage
## Usage of bootstrap
We used bootstrap while making our dropdown menu. 
## Usage of Jinja
We used jinja in the tastydeserts.html, where we passed a python list.
